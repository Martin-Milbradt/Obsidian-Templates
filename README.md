# Obsidian Templates

Templates for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) I've created which might also be useful to others.

## Requirements

All templates require the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin. Other requirements (if any are listed) in the script.  
The [Templater Scripts](Templater%20Scripts) called from the templates can be replaced by `JavaScript` functions with the same signatures.

## Notes

The files are tailored for my personal use. They contain `scriptOptions` for some configurability, but you are encouraged to make them your own. Let me know what works for you and what doesn't!  
Do not look at the files in [ZZ4 Templates](ZZ4%20Templaters) in GitHub's `Preview`, but use the `Code` view.
