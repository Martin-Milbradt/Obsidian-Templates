# Obsidian Templates

Templates for [Obsidian]([url](https://obsidian.md/)) I've created which might also be useful to others.

## Requirements

All templates require the [Templater]([url](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin. Other requirements (if any are listed) in the script.
The [Templater Scripts](Templater%20Scripts) called from the templates can be replaced by `JavaScript` functions with the same signatures.
